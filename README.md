# 🚀 AWS EKS Setup Guide

This repository provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for setting up, configuring, and deploying applications on **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**. Whether you're new to Kubernetes or looking to automate your cluster deployments on AWS, this guide will walk you through everything you need to get started.

## 🧠 Understanding Kubernetes Fundamentals

### 1.1 EKS vs. Self-Managed Kubernetes: Pros and Cons

#### ✅ EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service)

**Pros:**
- Fully managed control plane (API server, etcd, controller manager)
- Automated updates and patches
- Native integration with AWS IAM, VPC, ELB, CloudWatch
- High availability and scalability
- Security and compliance out-of-the-box
- Simplified logging and monitoring with CloudWatch

**Cons:**
- Higher cost compared to self-managed clusters
- Less customization/control of underlying infrastructure

#### ⚙️ Self-Managed Kubernetes on EC2

**Pros:**
- Cost-effective (use spot/reserved EC2)
- Full infrastructure customization
- Access to experimental features

**Cons:**
- Manual setup and maintenance
- No built-in HA or auto-scaling
- Higher security and compliance overhead

## 🔧 Setting up your AWS Environment for EKS

### 2.1 Creating an AWS Account and IAM Users

- Sign up at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com)
- Setup IAM users with programmatic access
- Use IAM groups and policies to assign permissions
- Optionally enable MFA for added security

### 2.2 Configuring the AWS CLI and `kubectl`

- Install AWS CLI: [Install Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- Configure AWS CLI:
  ```bash
  aws configure
  ```
- Install `kubectl`: [Install Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- Update kubeconfig to access EKS:
  ```bash
  aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <your-cluster-name>
  ```

### 2.3 Preparing Networking and Security Groups

#### 🔐 Configuring Security Groups

- Create security groups for EKS worker nodes
- Allow:
  - SSH (port 22) for admin access
  - Ingress/egress traffic as per app requirement
- Attach SGs during node group creation

#### 🌐 Setting up Internet Gateway (IGW)

- Create and attach an Internet Gateway to your VPC
- Update route tables to allow internet access (`0.0.0.0/0`)

#### 🛡️ IAM Policies & Roles

- Create IAM policies for EC2, EKS, ECR, etc.
- Attach these policies to the worker node IAM role
- Use the IAM role ARN when launching node groups

---

## 🚀 Launching your First EKS Cluster

- Option 1: AWS Management Console
- Option 2: AWS CLI
  ```bash
  eksctl create cluster --name demo-cluster --region us-east-1 --nodes 2
  ```
- Verify:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

---

## 📦 Deploying Applications on EKS

### 4.1 Containerizing Apps with Docker

- Write a `Dockerfile` for your app
- Build and push image to Amazon ECR:
  ```bash
  aws ecr create-repository --repository-name your-app
  docker tag your-app:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/your-app
  docker push <ecr-url>
  ```

### 4.2 Writing Kubernetes Deployment YAMLs

- Define Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, etc. in YAML
- Example:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: my-app
  spec:
    replicas: 2
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: my-app
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: my-app
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: <ecr-url>
          ports:
          - containerPort: 8080
  ```

### 4.3 Deploying to EKS

- Apply configs:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
  kubectl get all
  ```
- Use `LoadBalancer` or `Ingress` to expose your app

---

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure to clean up resources to avoid unnecessary costs:
  ```bash
  eksctl delete cluster --name demo-cluster
  ```
